# React Native Client App

After a first attempt while coding with Greg, we made a proof of concept to play parite. Here is the github project: https://github.com/cbrdev28/pariteClient

I decided to start from scratch again in order to implement things step by step "properly".

## First Goal

Make a new React Native App project with Typescript:

- Official tutorial: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
- Tutorial to setup the github project: https://medium.com/react-native-institute/how-to-use-git-with-react-native-687c12431e36

More about this project will be explained in the Runbook.md file (under the folder `docs`).
